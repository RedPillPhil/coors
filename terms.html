RISK OF COMPETITORS</h2><h3>Various types of decentralized applications and networks are emerging at a rapid rate, and the industry is increasingly competitive. It is possible that alternative networks could be established that utilize the same or similar code and protocol underlying the Company and attempt to re-create similar facilities. The Company may be required to compete with these alternative networks, which could negatively impact the Company.</h3></div><div class="flex flex-col space-y-2 mt-5"><h2 class="font-bold">21. RISK OF FAILING TO DEVELOP</h2><h3>There is the risk that the development of the Company will not be executed or implemented as planned, for a variety of reasons, including without limitation the event of a decline in the prices of any digital asset, virtual currency or the Company, unforeseen technical difficulties, and shortage of development funds for activities.</h3></div><div class="flex flex-col space-y-2 mt-5"><h2 class="font-bold">22.

RISK OF HACKING AND SECURITY WEAKNESSES</h2><h3>Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with the Company or underlying blockchains in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing. Furthermore, because the Company and underlying blockchains are based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party or a member of the Company team may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the Company or related blockchains, which could have negative consequences. The Company takes no responsibility for and expressly disclaims responsibility for such attacks/security weaknesses. Further, the Company shall bear no liability whatsoever, for any damage or interruptions caused by any computer viruses, spyware, scareware, Trojan horses, worms or other malware that may affect your computer or other equipment, or any phishing, spoofing or other attack.</h3></div><div class="flex flex-col space-y-2 mt-5"><h2 class="font-bold">24. RISK OF UNINSURED LOSSES</h2><h3>Unlike bank accounts or accounts at financial institutions, Tokens are uninsured unless you specifically obtain your own private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer or private insurance arranged by us, to offer recourse to you. The Company takes no responsibility in this regard and expressly disclaims same.</h3></div><div class="flex flex-col space-y-2 mt-5"><h2 class="font-bold">25.
